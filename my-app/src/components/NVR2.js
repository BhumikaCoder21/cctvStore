              NETWORK VIDEO RECORDER (NVR) are IP based devices used to connect
              multiple IP Cameras and to store video and images. These can be
              placed anywhere provided they are on the same LAN. Select the
              integrated NVR System or use your own Windows computer to create a
              Video Management Software System (VMS). If youâ€™re not sure which
              recording system to use, take a look at our IP camera video
              recording system comparison table.What is an NVR? An NVR is a
              Network Video Recorder. It is a network-attached computer system
              that includes video management and recording software, the
              computer and the hard drive storage. The NVR helps you install and
              manage the IP cameras. The management software allows you to
              include a recording schedule for the cameras, or use an alarm
              condition such as motion detection to cause the video to be
              recorded.
