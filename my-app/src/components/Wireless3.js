        Wireless cameras from CCTV Camera Delhi provide the freedom to install
        at any location where power is available without running a video cable,
        while maintaining the high standard that wired security cameras offer.
        You get several recording options, such as continuous recording or
        scheduled or motion activated recording to a computer / NVR or straight
        to a microSD card (not included). Indoor wireless cameras also feature a
        built-in microphone, two-way bi-directional audio, and Pan Tilt Zoom. If
        you donâ€™t have the time or resources to be constantly monitoring your
        security system, our wireless IP cameras can send you push notifications
        or email alerts straight to your smartphone or tablet.
